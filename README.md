## Food Truck Project second java project

### Overview

For this project I wrote a program that can take input from the user and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck. I defined a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a truck name, food type, and a numeric rating.
I created a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It has an array to store up to five Food Truck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

### Topics
* Taking user input to create objects in a separate class
* Used non static methods
* Created an Array
* Used information from the Array

### How to Run
Step 1. Input the name of a Food Truck to be reviewed.

Step 2. Input the type of food that truck serves.

Step 3. Input the rating on a scale from 1-5.

Step 4. Choose from the menu to see all the trucks, average rating of the food trucks, highest rated food truck, and quit the program.
